Py2D game utility library
=========================

Py2D attempts to help game developers with commonly found tasks, especially in vector-based games.

The library is still in very early development, among the features so far are:

* Classes for Vectors, Polygons and Affine Transformations with basic operations
* Polygonal Field-of-Vision Calculation
* Generate polygon obstructors from tile map data
* Perform boolean operations (union, intersection, difference) on polygons
* Grow and shrink polygons (polygon buffering, polygon offsetting)
* Decompose polygons into convex parts
