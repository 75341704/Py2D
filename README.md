Py2D game utility library
=========================

Py2D attempts to help game developers with commonly found tasks, especially in vector-based games.

The library is still in very early development, supported features so far are:

* Classes for Vectors and Polygons with basic operations
* Polygonal Field-of-Vision Calculation
* Generate polygon obstructors from tile map data
* Perform boolean operations (union, intersection, difference) on polygons
